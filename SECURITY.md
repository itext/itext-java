## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to maintaining the security of our software. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us as soon as possible.

To report a vulnerability, please visit our [Vulnerability Reporting Page](https://itextpdf.com/report-vulnerability), or email [vulnerability@apryse.com](vulnerability@apryse.com). If you do not receive a response in 2 business days, please follow up as we may not have received your message.

We follow the procedure of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) and, to protect the ecosystem, we request that those reporting do the same. Please visit the above page for more information, and follow the steps below to ensure that your report is handled promptly and appropriately:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we have had a chance to address it.
2. **Provide a detailed description** of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, if possible.
3. **Include any relevant information** such as the version of iText Core you are using, your operating system, and any other pertinent details.

## Security Updates and Patches

 When a vulnerability is reported, we will:

1. **Investigate and verify** the vulnerability.
2. **Develop and test** a fix for the vulnerability.
3. **Release a patch** as soon as possible.

## Known Vulnerabilities

The iText Knowledge Base has a page for known [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://kb.itextpdf.com/itext/cves) (CVEs), please check it to ensure your vulnerability has not already been disclosed or addressed.
