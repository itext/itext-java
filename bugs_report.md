## Unqiue Bugs Found
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Recently we ([Zhang Cen](https://github.com/occia) and [Huang Wenjie](https://github.com/ZanderHuang)) discovered a series of bugs in latest itextpdf (version 7.1.17).
Every bug we reported in the following is unique and reproducable. Furthermore, they have been manually analyzed and triaged in removing the duplicates.
<br />Due to the lack of contextual knowledge in the itextpdf library, we cannot thoroughly fix some bugs hence we look forward to any proposed plan from the developers in fixing these bugs.</p>
