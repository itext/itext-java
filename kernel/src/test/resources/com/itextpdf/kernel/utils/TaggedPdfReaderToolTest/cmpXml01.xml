To use iPhone, you need:

&#194; A new wireless service plan with the carrier that provides iPhone service in your area 

&#194; A Mac or a PC with a USB 2.0 port and one of the following operating systems:
</P>
<P>
&#194; Mac OS X version10.4.10 or later </P>

<H2>
Activating iPhone </H2>
<P>
Before you can use any of iPhone&#8217;s features, you must activate iPhone by signing up for 

a service plan with the iPhone service carrier in your area and registering iPhone with 

the network. If you already have a wireless account with the carrier, you may be able to 

upgrade your account to work with iPhone, or keep using your old phone and add a 

new line for iPhone. (Some accounts may not be upgradable.) You may also be able to 

transfer your current phone number to iPhone, or get a new one.
</P>
<P>

iPhone before activation. Read the documentation that comes with the SIM card for 
instructions. </P>
<P>
If your carrier gave you a PIN number to use with your SIM, you may need to enter the 
PIN before activating iPhone. </P>

3 Follow the onscreen instructions in iTunes to activate iPhone and sync iPhone with </P>
<P>
your contacts, calendars, email accounts, and bookmarks on your computer.

A single checkmark in &#8220;Set Up Your iPhone&#8221; syncs all these items automatically. Or you 

can use iTunes to customize the information you sync, and to sync your ringtones,

music, photos, podcasts, and videos to iPhone. See the following section.
</P>
<P>
You can disconnect iPhone from your computer after &#8220;Waiting for activation&#8221; appears 

on the iPhone screen. When activation is complete,&#8220;iPhone is activated&#8221; appears on 

the iPhone screen. This means that iPhone is fully functional and you can use all of its 

features.
</P>
<P>
Important: If you are migrating your current phone number to iPhone, activation may 

take from several hours to a day and migration of your number may take several days,

depending on your location and previous carrier.

Syncing iPhone with Your Computer </H3>
<P>
When you connect iPhone to your computer, iTunes syncs iPhone with the information 
and media on your computer, according to how you&#8217;ve configured the iPhone sync 
settings in iTunes. </P>
<P>
<alt><![CDATA[begin artwork description: An iPhone and a Mac computer with an arrow between the two showing that you can sync information between your iPhone and your computer.

</P>
<P>
You can set iTunes to sync any or all of the following: 
&#194; Contacts&#8212;names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, and so on 
&#194; Calendars&#8212;appointments and events 
&#194; Email account settings 
&#194; Webpage bookmarks 
&#194; Ringtones 
&#194; Music and audiobooks 
&#194; Photos 
&#194; Podcasts 
&#194; Videos </P>
<P>
Ringtones, music, audiobooks, podcasts, and video content are synced from your 
iTunes library. If you don&#8217;t already have content in iTunes, the iTunes Store (available in 
some countries) makes it easy to purchase or subscribe to content and download it to 
iTunes. You can also add music to your iTunes library from your CDs. To learn about 
iTunes and the iTunes Store, open iTunes and choose Help &gt; iTunes Help. </P>
<P>
Contacts, calendars, webpage bookmarks, and photos are synced from applications on 
your computer, as described below. Contacts and calendars are synced both ways 
between your computer and iPhone. New entries or changes you make on iPhone are 
synced to your computer, and vice versa. Webpage bookmarks are also synced both 
ways. </P>
<P>
Email account settings are only synced from your computer&#8217;s email application to 
iPhone. This allows you to customize your email accounts on iPhone without affecting 
email account settings on your computer. </P>
</Sect>

<P>
If you like, you can set iPhone to sync with only a portion of what&#8217;s on your computer. 
For example, you might want to sync only a group of contacts from your address book, 
or only unwatched video podcasts. You can adjust sync settings whenever iPhone is 
connected to your computer. </P>
<P>
Important: You can connect and sync with only one iPhone at a time. Disconnect one 
before connecting another. You should be logged in to your own user account on the 
computer before connecting iPhone. On a PC, if you sync more than one iPhone to the 
same user account, use the same sync settings for each. </P>
<Sect>
<H4>

from another country. 
When you&#8217;re traveling outside your carrier&#8217;s network, you may be able to choose 
among different carriers in the area where you&#8217;re traveling. 
Note: Roaming charges may apply. To avoid roaming charges, make sure Data Roaming 
is turned off.

iPod on iPhone works . . .  just like an iPod! iPhone syncs with iTunes on your computer 
to get the songs, videos, and other content you&#8217;ve collected in your iTunes library. </P>
</Sect>

<H2>
Syncing iPod Content from Your iTunes Library </H2>
<P>
If you&#8217;ve turned on syncing, iTunes automatically syncs content from your iTunes library 
to iPhone each time you connect it to your computer. iTunes lets you sync all of your 
media, or specific songs, videos, and podcasts. For example, you could set iTunes to 
sync selected music playlists and the three most recent episodes of your favorite video 
podcast. </P>
<P>
If there are more songs in your iTunes library than can fit on your iPhone, iTunes asks if 
you want to create a special playlist and set it to sync with iPhone. Then iTunes 
randomly fills the playlist. You can add or delete songs from the playlist and sync again. 
If you set iTunes to sync more songs, videos, and other content than can fit on iPhone, 
you can have iTunes automatically delete random content from iPhone to make room, 
or you can stop the sync and reconfigure your sync settings. </P>
<P endIndent="25.125" lineHeight="13" o="/Layout">
When you sync podcasts or audiobooks on iPhone with those on your computer, 
both iTunes and iPhone remember where you last left off and start playing from 
that position. </P>

Maps provides street maps, satellite photos, and hybrid views of locations in many of 
the world&#8217;s countries. You can get detailed driving directions and, in some areas, traffic 
information. Also in some areas, you can find your current approximate location, and 
1 
use that location to get driving directions to or from another place.</P>

Wi-Fi settings determine when iPhone uses local Wi-Fi networks to connect to the 
Internet. If no Wi-Fi networks are available, or you&#8217;ve turned Wi-Fi off, then iPhone 
connects to the Internet via your cellular network, when available. You can use Mail, 
Safari, YouTube, Stocks, Maps, and Weather over a cellular network connection, but not 
the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store. </P>

&#194; To enable or disable plug-ins, turn Plug-ins on or off. Plug-ins allow Safari to play some 
types of audio and video files and to display Microsoft Word files and Microsoft Excel 
documents. </P>
<P>
&#194; To block or allow pop-ups, turn Block Pop-ups on or off. Blocking pop-ups stops only 
pop-ups that appear when you close a page or open a page by typing its address.

<P>
&#194; To set whether Safari accepts cookies, tap Accept Cookies and choose Never,

&#8220;From visited,&#8221; or Always.
</P>

If iPhone calls your voicemail service when you tap Voicemail in Phone </P>
<P>
If the voice instructions prompt you, enter your voicemail password. Otherwise, wait 
until you hear any voice instruction, then end the call. After a time, Voicemail should 
become available again. </P>
<P>
If you can&#8217;t add or play a song, video, or other item </P>
<P>
The song may have been encoded in a format that iPhone doesn&#8217;t support.

The following audio file formats are supported by iPhone. These include formats 

for audiobooks and podcasting:
</P>
<P endIndent="107.75" lineHeight="15" o="/Layout">
&#194; AAC (M4A, M4B, M4P, up to 320 Kbps)

&#194; Apple Lossless (a high-quality compressed format)

&#194; MP3 (up to 320 Kbps)

&#194; MP3 Variable Bit Rate (VBR)

&#194; WAV

&#194; AAX (audible.com spoken word, AudibleEnhanced format)

&#194; AIFF

The following video file formats are supported by iPhone:

&#194; H.264 (Baseline Profile Level 3.0)

&#194; MPEG-4 (Simple Profile)
</P>
<P>
A song encoded using Apple Lossless format has full CD-quality sound, but takes up 

only about half as much space as a song encoded using AIFF or WAV format. The same 

song encoded in AAC or MP3 format takes up even less space. When you import music 

from a CD using iTunes, it is converted to AAC format by default.
</P>
<P>
Using iTunes for Windows, you can convert nonprotected WMA files to AAC or MP3 

format. This can be useful if you have a library of music encoded in WMA format.
</P>
<P>
iPhone does not support WMA, MPEG Layer 1, MPEG Layer 2 audio files, or audible.com 

format 1.
</P>
<P>
If you have a song or video in your iTunes library that isn&#8217;t supported by iPhone, you 

may be able to convert it to a format iPhone supports. See iTunes Help for more 

information.

If you entered information on iPhone that you don&#8217;t want to sync to your computer 
Replace contacts, calendars, mail accounts, or bookmarks on iPhone with information 
from your computer. 
1	 Open iTunes. 
2	 As you connect iPhone to your computer, press and hold Command-Option (if you&#8217;re 
using a Mac) or Shift-Control (if you&#8217;re using a PC) until you see iPhone in the iTunes 
Source pane. This prevents iPhone from syncing automatically.

Information of the selected type is erased from iPhone and replaced with what&#8217;s on 
your computer. The next time you sync, iPhone syncs normally, adding information
