========================================================================

If you have obtained a bundled AMSFonts collection (amsfonts.zip), this
will unpack into the standard TeX Directory Structure (TDS) tree.
First, determine the local TEXMF directory for your system, which we
will call texmf-local in this 00README file; this directory should be
identified in the documentation for the TeX distribution you're using.
Place the zip file into a convenient directory and unpack it using
the texmf-local directory as the "Extract to" target.  Some examples:

  WinZIP:  Click on "Extract" and then in the "Extract to" box, enter
           \sw\texmf-local  (or whatever the local branch of TEXMF is
           on your system)
  unzip:   unzip amsfonts.zip -d texmf-local

See the web page
  http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html
for some general information on identifying your local TEXMF tree and
installing fonts on various platforms.  (This includes specific details
for MikTeX, MacTeX, and other systems based on TeX Live.)

If your installation is not arranged in a TDS tree, see also the section
below, "Installing AMSFonts 3.0 on your system", as well as the user
documentation for your TeX distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What changes were made between AMSFonts 3.03 and AMSFonts 3.04?

Version 3.04 is a minor update to provide more fluid interoperability
with stix.sty.  It should be fully compatible with version 3.03.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What changes were made between AMSFonts 3.02 and AMSFonts 3.03?

The Type 1 Euler fonts have been upgraded from version 003.002 to
003.003 with the following changes:

1) Some inconsistencies with the character widths in the corresponding
   TFM files have been fixed.

2) Minor optimizations were carried out on some of the character
   outlines.

The changes affect only the PFB, AFM, and PFM files.  Thanks to Taco
Hoekwater and Stephen Moye.

What changes were made between AMSFonts 3.01 and AMSFonts 3.02?

The internal Unicode-compliant glyph names used for version 3.00 of
the Type 1 fonts resulted in a major incompatibility in reusing PDF
documents that had the previous version of the fonts embedded.  All
glyph names have now been reverted to their previous values and some
minor inconsistencies in the encoding vectors have been fixed.  This
affects all PFB and AFM files.

What changes were made between AMSFonts 3.00 and AMSFonts 3.01?

The encoding vectors of several of the Type 1 fonts were augmented
with some some duplicate entries in the high-bit range (128--255) for
compatibility with earlier releases of the fonts and with some older
PDF software that had trouble rendering characters with low character
codes (0-31).  Also, a couple of typos in the latxfont.map file were
fixed.

What changes were made between AMSFonts 2.2d and AMSFonts 3.0?

The licenses were restated to clarify the copying and redistribution
conditions to make them more compatible with third-party collections
such as TeX Live.  In particular, all Type 1 fonts and those .mf files
originally created at AMS are now released under the SIL Open Font
License (OFL), a copy of which is included with this distribution.

.pk files are no longer distributed or supported by the AMS.  Where
Type 1 fonts are available, modern TeX distributions do not require
PK fonts.  When PK fonts are required for some specialized purpose,
they can easily be generated on the fly.

In the Computer Modern fonts, some shape changes made by Donald Knuth
in 1992 were not included in the Type 1 fonts distributed in version 2.2
of the AMSFonts collection.  These shape changes have now been made,
and all CM glyph shapes should now be identical between Knuth's Metafont
sources and the Type 1 fonts.  Since Knuth's original changes did not
affect the metrics, no metrics were affected by this upgrade, and no
changes to the .tfm files were needed.  However, owing to the system
under which the reference copies of the .tfm files are archived, the
original file dates have been lost; recent file dates do not imply
any content changes.

The Euler fonts, designed by Hermann Zapf, were originally released in
the 1990s.  Zapf reshaped many of the glyphs, with implementation and
assistance from Hans Hagen, Taco Hoekwater, and Volker RW Schaa.  The
updated version 3.0 was presented to Donald Knuth on his birthday,
January 10, 2008.  These updates were carefully designed to work with
the metrics for version 2.2, so no changes to the .tfm files were
needed.  Since the updates were made directly to the Type 1 files,
the (incompatible) .mf files have been removed from the distribution.

There have been no shape changes to the "extra symbols" or cyrillic.

Where possible, all glyphs have been given Unicode-compliant names
to make them work better with Unicode-aware viewers (e.g.,
cut-and-paste of Cyrillic characters should work better).

Some modifications were made in the LaTeX support files to adapt to
the new set of (fully scalable) font sizes.  Now that Type 1 fonts
are available for all defined sizes, the "psamsfonts" option is no
longer needed.  This has been implemented in such a way as to ensure
that existing LaTeX input calling for this option will still compile.
In particular, any support files containing "57" in the file name
have been either eliminated or converted to no-ops.

The location of some files has changed, so if you are installing the
new distribution on top of an existing one, be sure to delete the
old copies from the previous locations.  Remove these directories
that are no longer used:

  doc/ams/amsfonts [replaced by doc/fonts/amsfonts]
  fonts/source/ams [replaced by fonts/source/public/amsfonts]
  fonts/tfm/ams [replaced by fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts]
  tex/latex/amsfonts/obsolete [obsolete; not superseded]

Also remove these files from the indicated areas:

  fonts/source/public/misc/dummy*
    [replaced by fonts/source/public/amsfonts/dummy]
  fonts/tfm/public/misc/dummy*
    [replaced by fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/dummy]

The manual (amsfndoc) will be updated later this year.  Some of the
information it contains is incomplete or obsolete.  In particular,
Appendix A, Installation Procedures, should be ignored completely;
see below for installation procedures if your system is not based on
a TDS structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What changes were made between AMSFonts 2.2 and AMSFonts 2.2d?

No changes were made to the fonts themselves, either to the Metafont
sources, the .tfm or .pk files.

The primary purpose of this upgrade was to fix bugs in the LaTeX
support files and to update the User's Guide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What changes were made between AMSFonts 2.1 and AMSFonts 2.2?

The primary change was the inclusion of LaTeX support macro files as
part of the AMSFonts distribution.  The files in the "latex"
subdirectory are compatible with LaTeX2e, the LaTeX standard since
1995.  Users of LaTeX 2.09 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to
LaTeX2e, as AMS no longer supports the use of AMSFonts with LaTeX 2.09.

The only significant change to the characters in the fonts was a bug
fix which corrected an anomaly in the Blackboard Bold N character from
the MSBM fonts. That character printed incorrectly at a few resolutions
(including 600dpi); it now prints correctly at all resolutions.  The
metrics for AMSFonts 2.2 were unchanged from those for AMSFonts 2.1. 

There was also a slight change to the file amssym.tex, and very
significant changes to the User's Guide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING AMSFonts 3.0 ON YOUR SYSTEM

These instructions assume that you were unable to unzip the bundle
directly into a TEXMF TDS tree.

1. Installing the fonts:

Unzip the bundle into a work area.  This will produce a tree with the
following structure:

  source
  source/latex
  source/latex/amsfonts
  tex
  tex/latex
  tex/latex/amsfonts
  tex/plain
  tex/plain/amsfonts
  fonts
  fonts/source
  fonts/source/public
  fonts/source/public/amsfonts
  fonts/source/public/amsfonts/cmextra
  fonts/source/public/amsfonts/cyrillic
  fonts/source/public/amsfonts/dummy
  fonts/source/public/amsfonts/symbols
  fonts/tfm
  fonts/tfm/public
  fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts
  fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/cmextra
  fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/cyrillic
  fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/dummy
  fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/euler
  fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/symbols
  fonts/type1
  fonts/type1/public
  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts
  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/cm
  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/cmextra
  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/cyrillic
  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/euler
  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/latxfont
  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/symbols
  fonts/afm
  fonts/afm/public
  fonts/afm/public/amsfonts
  fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/cm
  fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/cmextra
  fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/cyrillic
  fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/euler
  fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/latxfont
  fonts/afm/public/amsfonts/symbols
  fonts/map
  fonts/map/dvips
  fonts/map/dvips/amsfonts
  doc
  doc/fonts
  doc/fonts/amsfonts

Move the files in the branch  fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/  to the
directory where your system expects to find .pfb (Type 1) files.

Move the files in the branch  fonts/tfm/public/amsfonts/  to the
directory where your system expects to find .tfm files.

Update the map files for your device drivers using the .map files in
fonts/map/dvips/amsfonts/ ; consult the documentation for your TeX
distribution for advice.

Depending on what TeX system you use, it may also be necessary to update
a filename database; see the documentation for your TeX distribution.

2. Installing the (La)TeX support files:

There are two sets of files which provide macros necessary for using
AMSFonts 3.0 in TeX. One set is for Plain TeX or AMS-TeX, and one set
is for LaTeX.  If you use Plain TeX or AMS-TeX, then the files in
tex/plain/amsfonts/  should be placed in the directory (or a directory
in the path) which your implementation of TeX searches for input files.
If you use LaTeX, then the files in  tex/latex/amsfonts/  should be
placed in that directory. (If you use LaTeX 2.09, then we strongly
encourage you to upgrade to LaTeX2e; AMS does not provide support for
use of AMSFonts in LaTeX 2.09.)  If you are likely to use both LaTeX
and Plain TeX or AMS-TeX, then install the files from both directories
where your TeX will find them for input.

Depending on what TeX system you use, it may also be necessary to update
a filename database; see the documentation for your TeX distribution.

3. The User's Guide and other documentation:

You can get a copy of the User's Guide via a link on the web page

    http://www.ams.org/tex/amsfonts.html

The User's Guide still describes AMSFonts 2.2d; however, processing and
printing it from the files in this distribution is a good test of your
AMSFonts installation.

In order to TeX and print the User's Guide, you must first install the
fonts.  The "source" subdirectory (source/latex/amsfonts/) contains
five input files with names beginning with "amsfndoc".  When your font
installation is complete, process the file "amsfndoc.tex" with Plain
TeX (not AMS-TeX or LaTeX).  It will input four other "amsfndoc" files:
.def, .cyr, .ins and .fnt.  The output will be a complete guide to the
use of AMSFonts 2.2d.  Instructions for the use of the fonts themselves
are still valid, though somewhat incomplete; however, the installation
instructions in Appendix A are obsolete and should be ignored.  The
User's Guide is scheduled to be updated later this year.

The directory  source/latex/amsfonts/  contains a file named
"amsfonts.faq" in which we will place frequently asked questions about
AMSFonts.

This directory also contains LaTeX .dtx files containing technical
commentary on the source code for the LaTeX support files in the
AMSFonts distribution.  Although these .dtx files are included for
reference, most users can ignore them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

USE OF THE LATEX "amsfonts" PACKAGE

Version 3.0 of the LaTeX package amsfonts.sty is carefully constructed
to allow it to be used for processing pre-existing documents.  This
means that documents that load amsfonts.sty through statements such
as the following should continue to work without change.

1.  \documentclass{amsart}

2.  \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{amsfonts}

3.  \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{amsmath,amsthm}

4.  \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{amssymb}

There is an exception, however, for the variants 2 and 3: If your
document was written a very long time ago AND if it uses any of the
symbols

  \square                \Box
  \lozenge               \Diamond
  \vartriangleright      \rhd
  \vartriangleleft       \lhd
  \trianglerighteq       \unrhd
  \trianglelefteq        \unlhd
  \rightsquigarrow       \leadsto
                         \Join

then you may find that those symbol commands now produce "Undefined
control sequence" errors.  For the symbols in the first column, the
easiest way to fix this is to load the amssymb package, i.e. change
variants 2 and 3 to

2a.  \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage{amssymb}

3a.  \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage{amssymb,amsmath,amsthm}

For symbols in the second column (\Box, etc.), you have a choice of
either adding the latexsym package or defining them in terms of
equivalent symbols from the amssymb package.

If you are using an AMS document class (amsart, amsbook, amsproc), the
amsfonts are automatically included; however, you must load the amssymb
package to have access to the specific symbol names.
