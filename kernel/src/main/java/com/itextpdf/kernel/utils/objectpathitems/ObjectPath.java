 * You could say that CompareObjectPath instance consists of two parts: direct path and indirect path.
 * Direct path defines path to the currently comparing objects in relation to base objects. It could be empty,
 * which would mean that currently comparing objects are base objects themselves. Base objects are the two indirect
 * objects from the comparing documents which are in the same position in the pdf trees. Another part, indirect path,
 * defines which indirect objects were met during comparison process to get to the current base objects. Indirect path
 * is needed to avoid infinite loops during comparison.
