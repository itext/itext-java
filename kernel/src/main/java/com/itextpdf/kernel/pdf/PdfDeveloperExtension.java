 * Beginning with BaseVersion 1.7, the extensions dictionary lets developers
 * designate that a given document contains extensions to PDF. The presence
 * of the extension dictionary in a document indicates that it may contain
 * developer-specific PDF properties that extend a particular base version
 * of the PDF specification.
 * The extensions dictionary enables developers to identify their own extensions
 * relative to a base version of PDF. Additionally, the convention identifies
 * extension levels relative to that base version. The intent of this dictionary
 * is to enable developers of PDF-producing applications to identify company-specific
 * specifications that PDF-consuming applications use to interpret the extensions.
