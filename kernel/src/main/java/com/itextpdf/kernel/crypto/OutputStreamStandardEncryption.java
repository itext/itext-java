     * Writes {@code len} bytes from the specified byte array

     * some of the bytes in the array {@code b} are written to the
     * output stream in order; element {@code b[off]} is the first
     * byte written and {@code b[off+len-1]} is the last byte written
     * by this operation.
     * <p>
     * The {@code write} method of {@code OutputStream} calls
     * the write method of one argument on each of the bytes to be
     * written out. Subclasses are encouraged to override this method and
     * provide a more efficient implementation.
     * <p>
     * If {@code b} is {@code null}, a
     * {@code NullPointerException} is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If {@code off} is negative, or {@code len} is negative, or
     * {@code off+len} is greater than the length of the array
     * {@code b}, then an <tt>IndexOutOfBoundsException</tt> is thrown.
     *
     * @param b   the data.
     * @param off the start offset in the data.
     * @param len the number of bytes to write.
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs. In particular,
     *                     an {@code IOException} is thrown if the output
     *                     stream is closed.
