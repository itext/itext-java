<!-- Basque Hyphenation Patterns -->

<!-- (more info about the licence to be added later) -->

<!-- Hyphenation patterns for Basque. -->

<!-- This file has first been written by Juan M. Aguirregabiria -->
<!-- (juanmari.aguirregabiria@ehu.es) on February 1997 based on the -->
<!-- shyphen.sh script that generates the Spanish patterns as compiled -->
<!-- by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on September 1991. -->

<!-- In June 2008 the generating script has been rewritten into ruby and -->
<!-- adapted for native UTF-8 TeX engines. Patterns became part of hyph-utf8 -->
<!-- package and were renamed from bahyph.tex into hyph-eu.tex. -->
<!-- Functionality should not change apart from adding ñ by default. -->

<!-- The original Copyright followed and applied also to precessor of this file -->
<!-- whose last version will be always available by anonymous ftp -->
<!-- from tp.lc.ehu.es or by poynting your Web browser to -->
<!-- http://tp.lc.ehu.es/jma/basque.html -->

<!-- For more information about the new UTF-8 hyphenation patterns and -->
<!-- links to this file see -->
