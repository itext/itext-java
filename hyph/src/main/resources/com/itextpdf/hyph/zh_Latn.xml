<!-- Hyphenation patterns for unaccented pinyin syllables (CJK 4.8.0) -->

<!-- (more info about the licence to be added later) -->

<!-- This file is part of hyph-utf8 package and resulted from -->
<!-- semi-manual conversions of hyphenation patterns into UTF-8 in June 2008. -->

<!-- Source: pyhyph.tex (yyyy-mm-dd) -->
<!-- Author: Werner Lemberg <wl at gnu.org> -->

<!-- The above mentioned file should become obsolete, -->
<!-- and the author of the original file should preferaby modify this file instead. -->

<!-- Modificatios were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines, -->
<!-- but functionality (hopefully) didn't change in any way, at least not intentionally. -->
<!-- This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit engines -->
<!-- you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load this file) instead. -->

<!-- Modifications were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec & Arthur Reutenauer -->
<!-- with help & support from: -->
<!-- - Karl Berry, who gave us free hands and all resources -->
<!-- - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros -->
<!-- - Hans Hagen, who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long before -->
<!-- and helped with testing, suggestions and bug reports -->
<!-- - Norbert Preining, who tested & integrated patterns into TeX Live -->

<!-- However, the "copyright/copyleft" owner of patterns remains the original author. -->

<!-- The copyright statement of this file is thus: -->

<!-- Do with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of -->
<!-- "a better world" as long as you respect the copyright of original file. -->
<!-- If you're the original author of patterns or taking over a new revolution, -->
<!-- plese remove all of the TUG comments & credits that we added here - -->
<!-- you are the Queen / the King, we are only the servants. -->

<!-- If you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to CTAN, -->
<!-- we would be grateful if you could send it to us (http://tug.org/tex-hyphen) -->
<!-- or ask for credentials for SVN repository and commit it yourself; -->
<!-- we will then upload the whole "package" to CTAN. -->

<!-- Before a new "pattern-revolution" starts, -->
<!-- please try to follow some guidelines if possible: -->

<!-- - \lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it -->
<!-- - all the patterns should be in UTF-8 -->
<!-- - the only "allowed" TeX commands in this file are: \patterns, \hyphenation, -->
<!-- and if you really cannot do without, also \input and \message -->
<!-- - in particular, please no \catcode or \lccode changes, -->
<!-- they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex, -->
<!-- and no \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin, -->
<!-- they have no influence here and belong elsewhere -->
<!-- - \begingroup and/or \endinput is not needed -->
<!-- - feel free to do whatever you want inside comments -->

<!-- We know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser -->
<!-- at least a chance to read your patterns. -->

<!-- For more unformation see -->
