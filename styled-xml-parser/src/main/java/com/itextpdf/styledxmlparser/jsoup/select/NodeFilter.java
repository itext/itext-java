/**
 * Node filter interface. Provide an implementing class to {@link NodeTraversor} to iterate through nodes.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides two methods, {@code head} and {@code tail}. The head method is called when the node is first
 * seen, and the tail method when all of the node's children have been visited. As an example, head can be used to
 * create a start tag for a node, and tail to create the end tag.
 * <p>
 * For every node, the filter has to decide whether to
 * <ul>
 * <li>continue ({@link FilterResult#CONTINUE}),
 * <li>skip all children ({@link FilterResult#SKIP_CHILDREN}),
 * <li>skip node entirely ({@link FilterResult#SKIP_ENTIRELY}),
 * <li>remove the subtree ({@link FilterResult#REMOVE}),
 * <li>interrupt the iteration and return ({@link FilterResult#STOP}).
 * </ul>
 * The difference between {@link FilterResult#SKIP_CHILDREN} and {@link FilterResult#SKIP_ENTIRELY} is that the first
 * will invoke {@link NodeFilter#tail(Node, int)} on the node, while the latter will not.
 * Within {@link NodeFilter#tail(Node, int)}, both are equivalent to {@link FilterResult#CONTINUE}.
