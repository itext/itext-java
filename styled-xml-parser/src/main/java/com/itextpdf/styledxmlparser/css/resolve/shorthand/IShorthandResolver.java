 * CSS shorthand is a group of CSS properties that allow values of multiple properties to be set simultaneously. These
 * values are separated by spaces. For example, the border property is shorthand for the border-width, border-style, and
 * border-color properties. So in CSS, border: 5px solid red; would specify a border thatâ€™s five px wide, solid, and
 * red.
