/**
 * {@link ICssDataTypeValidator} implementation for identifiers.
 * In CSS, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs in selectors) can contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9]
 * and ISO 10646 characters U+00A0 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the underscore (_);
 * they cannot start with a digit, two hyphens, or a hyphen followed by a digit.
 * Identifiers can also contain escaped characters and any ISO 10646 character as a numeric code (see next item).
 * For instance, the identifier "B&amp;W?" may be written as "B\&amp;W\?" or "B\26 W\3F".
