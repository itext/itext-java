/**
 * <p>Represents a 2D matrix of bits. In function arguments below, and throughout the common
 * module, x is the column position, and y is the row position. The ordering is always x, y.
 * The origin is at the top-left.</p>
 *
 * <p>Internally the bits are represented in a 1-D array of 32-bit ints. However, each row begins
 * with a new int. This is done intentionally so that we can copy out a row into a BitArray very
 * efficiently.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ordering of bits is row-major. Within each int, the least significant bits are used first,
 * meaning they represent lower x values. This is compatible with BitArray's implementation.</p>
