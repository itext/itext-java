            "Portable Document Format (PDF), standardized as ISO 32000, is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 "
                    + "to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of "
                    + "application software, hardware, and operating systems. Based on the PostScript language,"
                    + " each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including "
                    + "the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other information needed to display it. "
                    + "PDF has its roots in \"The Camelot Project\" initiated by Adobe co-founder John Warnock in "
                    + "1991. "

                    + "PDF was standardized as ISO 32000 in 2008. The last edition as ISO 32000-2:2020 was "
                    + "published in December 2020. "

                    + "PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical "
                    + "structuring elements, interactive elements such as annotations and form-fields, layers, rich "
                    + "media (including video content), three-dimensional objects using U3D or PRC, and various other"
                    + " data formats. The PDF specification also provides for encryption and digital signatures, file"
                    + " attachments, and metadata to enable workflows requiring these features. "

                    + "History " + "Main article: History of PDF "
                    + "Adobe Systems made the PDF specification available free of charge in 1993. In the early years "
                    + "PDF was popular mainly in desktop publishing workflows, and competed with a variety of formats"
                    + " such as DjVu, Envoy, Common Ground Digital Paper, Farallon Replica and even Adobe's own "
                    + "PostScript format. "

                    + "PDF was a proprietary format controlled by Adobe until it was released as an open standard on "
                    + "July 1, 2008, and published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO "
                    + "32000-1:2008, at which time control of the specification passed to an ISO Committee of "
                    + "volunteer industry experts. In 2008, Adobe published a Public Patent License to ISO 32000-1 "
                    + "granting royalty-free rights for all patents owned by Adobe that are necessary to make, use, "
                    + "sell, and distribute PDF-compliant implementations. "

                    + "PDF 1.7, the sixth edition of the PDF specification that became ISO 32000-1, includes some "
                    + "proprietary technologies defined only by Adobe, such as Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) and"
                    + " JavaScript extension for Acrobat, which are referenced by ISO 32000-1 as normative and "
                    + "indispensable for the full implementation of the ISO 32000-1 specification. These "
                    + "proprietary technologies are not standardized and their specification is published only on "
                    + "Adobe's website. Many of them are also not supported by popular third-party "
                    + "implementations of PDF. "

                    + "In December 2020, the second edition of PDF 2.0, ISO 32000-2:2020, was published, including "
                    + "clarifications, corrections, and critical updates to normative references. ISO 32000-2 "
                    + "does not include any proprietary technologies as normative references. "

                    + "ISO's publication of ISO 32000-2 in 2017 ended the 24-year tradition of the latest PDF "
                    + "specification being freely available from Adobe. Starting in April, 2023, to provide PDF "
                    + "developers and stakeholders with their accustomed level of access, the PDF Association and its"
                    + " sponsors made ISO 32000-2 available for download at no cost. "

                    + "Technical details "
                    + "A PDF file is often a combination of vector graphics, text, and bitmap graphics. The basic "
                    + "types of content in a PDF are: "

                    + "Typeset text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in plain text); "
                    + "Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines; "
                    + "Raster graphics for photographs and other types of images "
                    + "Multimedia objects in the document. "
                    + "In later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), "
                    + "forms, JavaScript (initially available as a plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of "
                    + "embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins. "

                    + "PDF combines three technologies: "

                    + "An equivalent subset of the PostScript page description programming language but in "
                    + "declarative form, for generating the layout and graphics. "
                    + "A font-embedding/replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents. "
                    + "A structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single "
                    + "file, with data compression where appropriate. " + "PostScript language "
                    + "PostScript is a page description language run in an interpreter to generate an image, a "
                    + "process requiring many resources. It can handle graphics and standard features of programming "
                    + "languages such as if statements and loop commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but "
                    + "simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands equivalent to "
                    + "lineto remain. "

                    + "Historically, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The "
                    + "graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and tokenized"
                    + ".[clarification needed] Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are "
                    + "collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript "
                    + "world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.[citation needed] "

                    + "As a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript: "

                    + "PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct "
                    + "correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the "
                    + "resulting page appearance. "
                    + "PDF (since version 1.4) supports transparent graphics; PostScript does not. "
                    + "PostScript is an interpreted programming language with an implicit global state, so "
                    + "instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any "
                    + "following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to "
                    + "determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is "
                    + "unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final"
                    + " pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially"
                    + " before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript Document "
                    + "Structuring Conventions have been carefully compiled and included). "
                    + "PDF 1.6 and later supports interactive 3D documents embedded in a PDF file: 3D drawings can be"
                    + " embedded using U3D or PRC and various other data formats. "

                    + "File format "
                    + "A PDF file is organized using ASCII characters, except for certain elements that may have "
                    + "binary content. The file starts with a header containing a magic number (as a readable string)"
                    + " and the version of the format, for example %PDF-1.7. The format is a subset of a COS "
                    + "(\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format. A COS tree file consists primarily of objects, of "
                    + "which there are nine types: "

                    + "Boolean values, representing true or false " + "Real numbers " + "Integers "
                    + "Strings, enclosed within parentheses ((...)) or represented as hexadecimal within single angle"
                    + " brackets (<...>). Strings may contain 8-bit characters. "
                    + "Names, starting with a forward slash (/) "
                    + "Arrays, ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets ([...]) "
                    + "Dictionaries, collections of objects indexed by names enclosed within double angle brackets "
                    + "(<<...>>) "
                    + "Streams, usually containing large amounts of optionally compressed binary data, preceded by a "
                    + "dictionary and enclosed between the stream and endstream keywords. " + "The null object "
                    + "Furthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (%). Comments may contain"
                    + " 8-bit characters. "

                    + "Objects may be either direct (embedded in another object) or indirect. Indirect objects are "
                    + "numbered with an object number and a generation number and defined between the obj and endobj "
                    + "keywords if residing in the document root. Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects "
                    + "(except other streams) may also be located in special streams known as object streams (marked "
                    + "/Type /ObjStm). This technique enables non-stream objects to have standard stream filters "
                    + "applied to them, reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects "
                    + "and is especially useful for Tagged PDF. Object streams do not support specifying an object's "
                    + "generation number (other than 0). "

                    + "An index table, also called the cross-reference table, is located near the end of the file and"
                    + " gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file. This design "
                    + "allows for efficient random access to the objects in the file, and also allows for small "
                    + "changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (incremental update). Before PDF version "
                    + "1.5, the table would always be in a special ASCII format, be marked with the xref keyword, and"
                    + " follow the main body composed of indirect objects. Version 1.5 introduced optional "
                    + "cross-reference streams, which have the form of a standard stream object, possibly with "
                    + "filters applied. Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross-reference table and "
                    + "contains the offsets and other information in binary format. The format is flexible in that it"
                    + " allows for integer width specification (using the /W array), so that for example, a document "
                    + "not exceeding 64 KiB in size may dedicate only 2  bytes for object offsets. "

                    + "At the end of a PDF file is a footer containing "

                    + "The startxref keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross-reference table "
                    + "(starting with the xref keyword) or the cross-reference stream object, followed by "
                    + "The %%EOF end-of-file marker. "
                    + "If a cross-reference stream is not being used, the footer is preceded by the trailer keyword "
                    + "followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the "
                    + "cross-reference stream object's dictionary: "

                    + "A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the catalog (/Root) "
                    + "The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table (/Size) "
                    + "Other optional information "
                    + "Within each page, there are one or multiple content streams that describe the text, vector and"
                    + " images being drawn on the page. The content stream is stack-based, similar to PostScript. "

                    + "The maximum size of a PDF compared to Europe. "
                    + "There are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linearized (not \"optimized\") and linearized "
                    + "(\"optimized\"). Non-linearized PDF files can be smaller than their linear counterparts, "
                    + "though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of "
                    + "the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linearized PDF files (also called "
                    + "\"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to"
                    + " be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since all "
                    + "objects required for the first page to display are optimally organized at the start of the "
                    + "file. PDF files may be optimized using Adobe Acrobat software or QPDF. "

                    + "Page dimensions are not limited by the format itself. However, Adobe Acrobat imposes a limit "
                    + "of 15 million in by 15 million in, or 225 trillion in2 (145,161 km2). "

                    + "Imaging model "
                    + "The basic design of how graphics are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript,"
                    + " except for the use of transparency, which was added in PDF 1.4. "

                    + "PDF graphics use a device-independent Cartesian coordinate system to describe the surface of a"
                    + " page. A PDF page description can use a matrix to scale, rotate, or skew graphical elements. A"
                    + " key concept in PDF is that of the graphics state, which is a collection of graphical "
                    + "parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a page description. PDF has (as of "
                    + "version 2.0) 25 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are: "

                    + "The current transformation matrix (CTM), which determines the coordinate system "
                    + "The clipping path " + "The color space "
                    + "The alpha constant, which is a key component of transparency "
                    + "Black point compensation control (introduced in PDF 2.0) " + "Vector graphics "
                    + "As in PostScript, vector graphics in PDF are constructed with paths. Paths are usually "
                    + "composed of lines and cubic Bézier curves, but can also be constructed from the outlines of "
                    + "text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and "
                    + "curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, fill then stroked, or used for clipping. Strokes and "
                    + "fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including patterns. PDF supports several "
                    + "types of patterns. The simplest is the tiling pattern in which a piece of artwork is specified"
                    + " to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a colored tiling pattern, with the colors specified in "
                    + "the pattern object, or an uncolored tiling pattern, which defers color specification to the "
                    + "time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a shading pattern, which draws"
                    + " continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading patterns of which the simplest "
                    + "are the axial shading (Type 2) and radial shading (Type 3). "

                    + "Raster images "
                    + "Raster images in PDF (called Image XObjects) are represented by dictionaries with an "
                    + "associated stream. The dictionary describes the properties of the image, and the stream "
                    + "contains the image data. (Less commonly, small raster images may be embedded directly in a "
                    + "page description as an inline image.) Images are typically filtered for compression purposes. "
                    + "Image filters supported in PDF include the following general-purpose filters: "

                    + "ASCII85Decode, a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit ASCII, "
                    + "ASCIIHexDecode, similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact, "
                    + "FlateDecode, a commonly used filter based on the deflate algorithm defined in RFC 1951 "
                    + "(deflate is also used in the gzip, PNG, and zip file formats among others); introduced in PDF "
